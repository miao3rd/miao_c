These files are simulation codes for close-range millimeter wave SAR imaging. 
The repository contains four files, fftw3.h, kernel.cu, pms_cuda.h, and pms_spline_cuda.h. 
The FFT operations in the code use the FFTW library, so the FFTW environment needs to be configured. 
The kernel.cu is the main framework of the entire SAR simulation program. 
For ease of operation, the code uses simulated radar echo data. The PMS is short for pointer manage struct. 
The PMS structure is designed for matrices and records the matrix pointer, length, number of dimensions and the length of each dimension. 
The pms_spline_cuda.h is a code written for the speedup of cubic spline interpolation based on the pms_cuda.h. 
The pms_spline_cuda.h is the method proposed in this paper, which allows parallel computation of cubic spline interpolation for multiple inputs. 
These codes are for academic research purposes only and cannot be used for commercial purposes without permission.
